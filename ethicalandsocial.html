<h1>Ethical & Social Implications of IoT</h1>
<p>The main ethical concern of the internet of things is the privacy of the users. With devices collecting data about your personality, shopping habits, physical well-being, and much more, the question is if this is ethical. Scott Peppet of the Texas Law Review also discusses the importance of consent with IoT connected devices. “Consumer consent offers one way to reconcile these competing realities: if consumers understand and consent to the data flows generated by their Fitbits, car monitors, smart home devices, and smartphones, perhaps there is no reason to worry” (Peppet 2014). The problem with consumer consent is that many times the devices used to track data are often small, screenless, and offer no input or output (Peppet 2014). For this reason, users may not even understand the terms and conditions of these devices, and how they are using their data. Offering users a privacy policy or a terms and conditions page is crucial for those that don’t want their personal data shared with companies.</p>
<p> “A study from Hewlett-Packard found that 90 percent of connected devices are collecting personal information, and 70 percent of them are transmitting data without encryption” (“One Year Later”, 2015). This is a harrowing statistic and reminds us that our personal information is constantly being collected and transmitted to the companies who manufacture these IoT devices. These ethical questions are also directly tired with the potential security risks of the IoT, as many of these devices are designed with usability and not security in mind. They are often cheap to manufacture as well. It is important that the general public who own and operate these IoT connected devices are educated on the data sharing that occurs when using this technology.
