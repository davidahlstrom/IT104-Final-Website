<h1>Conclusion</h1>
<p>The internet of things is becoming rapidly more commonplace in our society, and it is up to the designers, the users, and even governments to ensure that it is being used for our best interest. The increased efficiency and connectivity of these devices allows us to communicate with each other and optimize our daily lives. Smart watches can keep us fit, and smart cities can lead to better energy efficiency and a cleaner environment. The security and privacy concerns should certainly be understood and talked about in order to protect users. Itâ€™s important that individuals understand which devices are IoT connected, and how to protect yourself from cyber threats. While some may believe that the IoT is a net negative for society, the possibilities are endless when devices are connected to each other at such a large scale.
