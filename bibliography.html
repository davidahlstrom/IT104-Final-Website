<br><br>
Bray’s Boston Globe news article describes the planned security test of the Chrysler automobile’s IoT system. She talks about the threat the IoT poses to automobiles. She also talks to various experts in the technology field and how security measures could be implemented to keep drivers safe from these attacks. This article is great for specific examples of how the IoT allows cyber attacks to become disastrous, due to the interconnected nature of these devices. Bray asks very legitimate questions and describes the potential chaos of IoT cyber attacks. I consider this article to be reliable as Bray documents the Chrysler car hack situation and elaborates on the future of these IoT connected car systems, and their potential security risks.

<br><br>
Jayaraman and Georgakopoulos’ “Internet of things: from internet scale sensing to smart services” could best be described as a crash course in IoT. They describe its uses, applications, and potential issues. They also go more in depth on how IoT devices collect data and how these companies are using this data. They also define Semantic sensor networks, or SSN, and how these systems are used to define and discover IoT devices and their data. I was able to learn the basics of IoT as well as specific applications. With specific applications presented by the authors in this article, they are able to describe my research topic in a broad sense. This was a very reliable source of information for my research.

<br><br>
Yu-li and colleagues scholarly journal article poses a question about the trustworthiness of IoT. Data collection and privacy is a big issue amongst users as well as governments. They describe how “big data” and IoT are essential components of an interconnected society, and how they could lead to reduced trust in the online environment. The authors give benefits as well as ethical risks involving IoT and data collection. This brief journal article raised similar concerns I have with IoT, how these companies plan to collect and use individuals’ data. This article is certainly reliable as it discusses the legal and ethical issues of IoT and data sharing, with specific, cited examples.

<br><br>
This article primarily discusses the ethical implications of big data and the IoT. They talk about how the federal government, specifically the Obama administration, took efforts to protect individuals privacy in the IoT era. They also talk about how the data collected from IoT devices does have benefits, specifically in the healthcare and transportation industry. They ask important questions and state that these companies are not designing these IoT devices with security in mind, rather usability. They also talk about the “Consumer Privacy Bill of Rights” and how this might need to be implemented in the IoT connected world.

<br><br>
Scott Peppet’s “Regulating the Internet of Things: First Steps Toward Managing 
Discrimination, Privacy, Security, and Consent” is a deeper dive into the issue of privacy in the IoT ecosystem. He describes how these companies tend to slip around offering explicit consent forms. He also talks about government policy that is mandated to prevent privacy intrusion. The most interesting aspect of Peppet’s article for me is how some IoT devices are unable to offer information on how they collect and process user data. This can lead to users being blind to the fact that their actions are being tracked and used by companies. The ambiguity of these devices is a bit harrowing, and can lead to further privacy intrusions. Scott Peppet’s article is very reliable, and was crucial to my research on the legal and ethical issues of IoT. This article was extensive, and provided copious examples and sources and data sharing.

<br><br>
Sion gives specific examples of IoT being implemented in the form of smart cities. He collected data from thousands of respondents in order to formulate the results. He gives empirical evidence of a few examples, such as how smart cities can reduce the cost of living. He also discusses how cities fund IoT infrastructure. I was able to learn through evidence and numbers of IoT is shaping our cities. Although this article was listed without an author, I believe it is a reliable source due to the specific, cited examples listed and discussed in the article.

<br><br>
Sultan offers a brief history of IoT and estimates what it will look like in the future. Some examples of what he believes is the future of IoT are effective electricity generation, smart cities, and revolutionizing retail markets. We can see some of these implanted today. He also offers concerns primarily surrounding the security aspects of IoT. Sultan believes that IoT is the “next big thing” we would see in the world, and I would argue that it is the “current big thing”. I consider Sultan’s article to be reliable as he discusses the documented history of IoT and hypothesizes the future of this technology. He offers current uses of IoT and elaborates more so on the future.

<br><br>
This brief business news source article published by the Mena Report provides yet another example of IoT being implemented in various fields. The food safety industry is discussed, and how a corporation called Emerson is using small IoT connected sensors to track the temperature of transported food in order to maintain the safety of consumption. The article also describes how consumers are concerned about food safety, and that these devices can help protect the consumers. This article is reliable because they are simply stating news and not providing any personal opinion on the matter. Statistics and examples are provided, which allowed me to gain further knowledge on how IoT is implemented in our world. My research was greatly enhanced by this article.

<br><br>
Velliangiri and colleagues’ book contains a vast amount of information regarding the history of IoT, blockchain, and security measures implemented in IoT spaces. They discuss how different security measures, such as AI integration, blockchain integration, and cryptography integration in IoT are all potential positives in increasing security and data privacy. I didn’t read the entirety of the book, but to briefly summarize the chapter in which I did read, where the authors discussed the integration of AI in IoT security systems, Velliangiri and colleagues described how these AI systems are coded and taught to protect IoT devices. Through machine learning, these AI systems capture and process data in order to determine if this data is safe to collect and share. This book is a reliable source of information for my research as they provided copious citations and resources used to write this book.

Description - This image depicts the internet of things and how various devices are connected to this vast network. It containes pictures of laptops, smart phones, and gaming devices that are all connected to the internet of things.
</br>
</br>
Annotation - I covered the internet of things in my research. I was searching for an image that would encapsulate the overall concept of the internet of things. This image perfectly illustrates of the internet of things is a broadly connected network of many different devices. The image also depicts things that may not be devices, such as the sense of taste or sight, included in the picture. I believe that it was smart to do so as the artist was probably depicting the fact that companies use data collected by internet of things devices to track our lifestyle choices, such as where we eat or where we go to enjoy ourselves. This picture is simple yet is able to perfectly define what the internet of things represents.
