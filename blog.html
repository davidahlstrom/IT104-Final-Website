<h3>Entry 1:The Potential Security and Privacy Threats with the Internet of Things</h3>
<h4>10/21/2021</h4>
<p>The internet of things, commonly referred to as "IoT", is the way to define the growing connectivity between various devices that can access the internet. These devices collect data and the companies that own these devices use this data for a variety of reasons. Due to this connectivity between devices, security threats are a critical issue to discuss as these devices contain personal data of its users. The privacy of users in the IoT ecosystem is also a widely discussed topic as companies can use this collected data to sell to advertisers or adjust marketing tactics. While the internet of things allows users to connect with others seemlessly and usefully, there are potential risks.</p>
<p>One example of the implementation of these devices for a good purpose is in the medical field. Doctors can use IoT connected devices to monitor patients from afar, allowing for more efficient and safer patient contact. One example of security threats being incredibly important also applies to the medical field. If these devices were hijacked, specifically medical devices such as heartrate monitors, this could lead to disastrous effects for the users. Cars, smartwatches, and various other devices are all potential victims of these cyber attacks. The ethical concerns of the internet of things is also widely discussed. Should companies be allowed to use data gained from these devices for whatever purpose? Smart home devices, smart watches, and smart phones are constantly tracking the user and collecting data, even without notifying the user. While the uses of the internet of things has greatly improved society in its effort to become even more connected, these downsides and potential security risks are critical to maintaining the safety and privacy of users.
