<h1>The Future of IoT</h1>
<p>The internet of things is advancing incredibly quickly, and we are already seeing new systems in place that we didn’t see only a few years ago. One example of the internet of things moving into the future are smart cities. Smart cities encompass cars, homes, offices, parking lots, and everything else that a city contains (Sultan 2017). Through the use of IoT devices, such as sensors and lights, this data being collected can improve infrastructure and public utilities. An example of IoT being implemented in offices is each individual would post their schedule, and depending on what office they are assigned, different rooms or offices could be lowered or raised in temperature, leading to less energy consumption. The only foreseeable future in IoT is even more connectivity, and with more connectivity comes more technological advancement, increased quality of life, but also security and privacy threats. As the IoT grows, I hypothesize that we will see more possible government intervention on the data transmission that occurs in these devices in order to further protect the general public from cyber-hackers. Hopefully, as these devices and connected systems become more advanced, so do the security measures implemented to keep the users safe.</p>
<p> The future of IoT could also involve a popular advancement in the information technology field, artificial intelligence. Artificial intelligence, or AI, systems are implemented on a large scale in businesses to increase the efficiency of whatever computational process is occurring. These systems learn from previous mistakes and can perform tasks that previously may have required a human to perform. In the book, Internet of Things: Integration and Security Challenges, S. Velliangiri and colleagues discuss how AI and machine learning play a role in protecting the networks of IoT devices, specifically in the healthcare field. “The process of profiling devices, capturing network information, and identifying threats are all necessary steps that require AI/ML to cope with modern network conditions and continuously evolving malware” (Velliangiri et al., 2021). Not only can these AI programs lessen the workload of humans operating computer systems, but they can also be much quicker at discovering and solving security issues. Much of the future of IoT includes various other emerging technologies in the information technology field.
